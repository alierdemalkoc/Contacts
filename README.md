# Contacts

I developed this app for show how to use Room, Hilt and navigation component. I made a basic app and a rudimentary UI to understand CRUD operations of RoomDB and Hilt usage with navigation implementation more easy.

<br/>Contains:<br/>
* Room DB<br/>
* Lifecycle Component - ViewModel<br/>
* Dependency injection with Hilt<br/>
* Navigation Component<br/>
* View Binding<br/>
